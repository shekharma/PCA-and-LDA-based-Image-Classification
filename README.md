# PCA-and-LDA-based-Image-Classification
## Overview
This project aims to classify images into different classes using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classification. PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the image data, while LDA is applied to classify the reduced feature vectors into their respective classes.


## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Image Datasets

### Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in image processing and computer vision. It aims to capture the most important information in high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving as much variance as possible. In the context of image datasets, PCA can be applied to reduce the dimensionality of the image data while retaining its essential features.

### Steps of PCA for Image Datasets

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - The image data is typically represented as a high-dimensional matrix, where each row corresponds to an image and each column corresponds to a pixel value.
   - Before applying PCA, it's common to preprocess the image data by centering it around its mean. This step ensures that the mean of each pixel value across all images is zero.

2. **Covariance Matrix Calculation**:
   - PCA operates by computing the covariance matrix of the centered image data.
   - The covariance matrix represents the relationships between different pixel values across all images in the dataset.

3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**:
   - The next step involves performing eigenvalue decomposition (or singular value decomposition) on the covariance matrix.
   - This yields the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which represent the principal components and their corresponding variances, respectively.

4. **Selection of Principal Components**:
   - The principal components are ranked in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues.
   - The top \(k\) eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are selected to form the new basis for the lower-dimensional subspace.

5. **Projection onto Lower-Dimensional Space**:
   - Finally, the original high-dimensional image data is projected onto the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the selected principal components.
   - This results in a new representation of the image data with reduced dimensionality, where each image is represented by a set of principal component scores.

### Interpretation of Principal Components
- The principal components obtained from PCA represent the directions of maximum variance in the image dataset.
- Each principal component captures a different aspect of the variation present in the images. For example, the first principal component might capture global variations in brightness or contrast, while subsequent components capture more localized patterns or textures.
- By retaining only the top \(k\) principal components, PCA effectively summarizes the essential features of the image dataset while discarding less relevant information.

### Applications of PCA in Image Processing
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of image datasets, making them more manageable for downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or visualization.
- **Noise Reduction**: PCA can be used to denoise images by focusing on the principal components that capture the signal while ignoring components associated with noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: PCA can serve as a feature extraction technique, where the principal component scores are used as input features for machine learning algorithms.




## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for Image Classification

### Introduction
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for classification tasks. In the context of image classification, LDA aims to find a lower-dimensional subspace that maximizes the separation between different classes while minimizing the variance within each class. By projecting the high-dimensional image data onto this discriminative subspace, LDA enables effective classification of images into predefined classes.

### Steps of LDA for Image Classification

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - As with PCA, the image data is represented as a high-dimensional matrix, where each row corresponds to an image and each column corresponds to a feature (e.g., pixel value).
   - Before applying LDA, the image data is typically centered around its mean to ensure that each class has a similar mean feature vector.

2. **Within-Class Scatter Matrix**:
   - LDA begins by computing the within-class scatter matrix, which represents the dispersion of data points within each class.
   - The within-class scatter matrix is computed as the sum of the covariance matrices of individual classes, weighted by the number of samples in each class.

3. **Between-Class Scatter Matrix**:
   - Next, LDA computes the between-class scatter matrix, which measures the separation between different classes.
   - The between-class scatter matrix is computed as the sum of outer products of the differences between class mean vectors, weighted by the number of samples in each class.

4. **Eigenvector Decomposition**:
   - LDA then performs eigenvector decomposition on the generalized eigenvalue problem defined by the ratio of the between-class scatter matrix to the within-class scatter matrix.
   - This yields the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues, which represent the directions of maximum separation between classes.

5. **Selection of Discriminant Vectors**:
   - The discriminant vectors are selected from the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues.
   - The top \(k\) eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are retained to form the lower-dimensional subspace.

6. **Projection onto Lower-Dimensional Space**:
   - Finally, the original high-dimensional image data is projected onto the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the selected discriminant vectors.
   - This results in a new representation of the image data with reduced dimensionality, where each image is represented by a set of discriminant scores.

### Interpretation of Discriminant Vectors
- The discriminant vectors obtained from LDA represent the directions of maximum separation between classes in the image dataset.
- Each discriminant vector captures a different aspect of the variation between classes, with the first few vectors typically capturing the most discriminative information.

### Applications of LDA in Image Classification
- **Feature Extraction**: LDA serves as a feature extraction technique, transforming the high-dimensional image data into a lower-dimensional space that is more amenable to classification algorithms.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: By selecting the most discriminative dimensions, LDA reduces the dimensionality of image data while retaining class-specific information, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of classification algorithms.
- **Classification**: LDA provides a basis for classification algorithms to make decisions by maximizing the separation between different classes in the feature space.

### Conclusion

In summary, both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) offer powerful techniques for analyzing and classifying image datasets. 

PCA focuses on reducing the dimensionality of image data while retaining as much variance as possible, making it useful for efficient representation and visualization of image datasets.

On the other hand, LDA emphasizes maximizing the separation between different classes in the image dataset, enabling effective classification into predefined classes.

Together, PCA and LDA provide complementary approaches for image analysis, with PCA capturing the overall structure and variability of the data, while LDA focuses on the discriminative information for classification. These techniques are valuable tools in various fields, including computer vision, pattern recognition, and image processing.
